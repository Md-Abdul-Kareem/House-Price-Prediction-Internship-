# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

Welcome to my Data Science Internship project!  
In this project, I built a **Simple Linear Regression model** to predict house prices based on area and number of bedrooms using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains 545 housing records with features like:
- `price`
- `area` (square footage)
- `bedrooms`
- `bathrooms`, `parking`, and others

📁 Source: `Housing.csv`

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 🚀 Workflow
1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Preprocess and clean the data
4. Train a Linear Regression model
5. Evaluate model performance
6. Visualize predictions

---

## 📈 Model Performance
- R² Score: `...`  
- MAE: `...`  
- RMSE: `...`

*(Values shown after model evaluation)*
